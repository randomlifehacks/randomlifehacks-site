        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Will there be more outfits/backgrounds?</h3>
        <p class="bean-update">
          New outfits will be uploaded every few days. 
          Feel free to email me at randomlifehacksreq@gmail.com for requests :)
        </p>

        <h3>How do I use the printable files?</h3>
        <p>
          Simply hit the download link below the image you want, print, and enjoy!
        </p>

        <h3>What size should I print things?</h3>
        <p>
          As long as you print them all at the same size, it doesn't truly matter.
          I prefer a5 size at 110% ratio.
        </p>

        <h3>Why did you make Dress Bean?</h3>
        <p>First - this section will be long as Google prefers websites with over 600 words.</p>
        <p>I created Bean as a way to pass time. I love drawing, arts and crafts, anything that keeps my hands busy.</p>
        <p>When I first created Bean, it was really a self project. Whenever I'd get bored, I'd doodle a new outfit for Bean.</p>
        <p>Every time I made a new background or new outfit, I'd send it to my friends and they'd keep telling me that I should make "Dress Bean" a business.</p>
        <p>I however, refuse to lol. Bean is free for me to draw and print. That was kind of the appeal of it.</p>
        <p>I tend to bounce from hobby to hobby, but with Bean, I bounce from outfit to outfit which saves money. It didn't feel right to charge other people for it.</p>
        <p>Now Dress Bean is a part of my Random Life Hacks website so my friends print Bean and the accesories for their kids to play with!</p>
